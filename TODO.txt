This is a todo list that described items related to the new templating
system and inflicted changes. It is to be removed once everything is
completed.

- documentation:

  * XML template schema

  * how to customize / make a distribution

  * how to add a feature

- Testing framework for make.xsl

- For some reason, &nbsp; entities are replaced with an empty string,
  causing tags to be closed in the short syntax. That confuses browsers.

- Get rid of saveonpart code in startkupu and put it in the saveonpart
  feature

- Command for the plone-drawers merge:

    svn merge \
      http://codespeak.net/svn/epoz/branch/duncan-plone-branch@3123 \
      http://codespeak.net/svn/kupu/branch/plone-drawers@HEAD \
      trunk/kupu

  Resulting conflicts (there will be a lot) will have to be resolved
  carefully. There will be conflicts even of unchanged files such as
  the button images. These need to be reverted
