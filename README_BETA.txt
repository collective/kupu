===============
Kupu 1.1 beta 1
===============

This is a beta release of the Kupu editor.  It will almost certainly
contain bugs and the documentation is not complete.  Also there are
some features that haven't been fully completed yet (for example the
layout of the drawers).

If you encounter any real bugs (not just missing UI parts) please
report them in our issue tracker at http://codespeak.net/issues/kupu/.
We will try to fix them before the next release.  For further
information, see the kupu webpage at http://kupu.oscom.org.

We hope you like the product, if you have suggestions about
improvements please let us know at kupu-dev@codespeak.net!

Greetings,

the Kupu team - Paul Everitt, Philipp von Weitershausen and Guido Wesdorp
