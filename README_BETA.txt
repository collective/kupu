===============
Kupu 1.1 beta 1
===============

This is a beta release of the Kupu editor. It will almost certainly contain
bugs and the documentation is not complete. Also there are some features that
haven't been completed (especially the drawers' html isn't completely done) or
could use some more work.

If you encounter any real bugs (not just missing UI parts) please report them
in our issue tracker (for more information see http://kupu.oscom.org), we will 
try to fix them before the next release.

We hope you like the product, if you have suggestions about improvements please
let us know!

Greetings,

the Kupu team - Paul Everitt, Philipp von Weitershausen and Guido Wesdorp
