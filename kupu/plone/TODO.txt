TODO for drawers

- improve library drawer UI

- IE support --> guido

- Description in the rightmost bar needs to be trimmed, in case it's a
  long string. Can XSLT do that?!? --> paul?

- Reload libraries / current collection functionality
  A lot of it is already in place. See comments in JS

- test xml output, or rather the corresponding python methods

- provide automatic preview views?

- i18n of xml? --> currently not possible because ZPT deliberately
  disable i18n for xml (at least in Zope2).
