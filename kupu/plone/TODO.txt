TODO for drawers

- merge kupudrawertool.js and kupulibrarydrawers.js to kupudrawers.js

- improve library drawer UI

  + particular problem: "Current location: ..." is only shown when a
    drawer is closed and re-opened. CSS problem?

- table drawers

  + improve UI

- issue 63: set text/html as content type when editing w/ kupu
  Can't reproduce?!?

- provide external link functionality

  + drawer or dialog?

  + admin should be able to disable/enable it

- IE problems:

  + IE6 on WinXP crashes upon saving, if a drawer has been opened in
    the Kupu session.
    Fix: get rid of the drawer element before saving form
    data. Implemented and tested by guido, no confirmation yet

  + xsl:import needs provide a valid URI; it seems IE cannot import an
    XSL file that is linked with a relative path (as reported by
    duncan, reproduced by philiKON). Fix in Plone: generate XSL
    templates with ZPT, providing an absolute URI for the import
    statements.

  + container.ownerDocument.contentWindow = doc.contentWindow;
    fails: "object doesn't support this property or method". Solution:
    do not execute on IE (it seems not to be needed anyway).

  + importNode(node) fails on XML Document nodes. Use
    node.cloneNode(true) as a hack.

  + IE doesn't seem to accept the dynamic setting of display:block. It
    does not display the element as a block element, but inline.
    Solution: wrap the div that is to appear as a block element in
    another <div style="display:block;"> element.

- test xml output, or rather the corresponding python methods

- provide automatic preview views?

- i18n of xml? --> currently not possible because ZPT deliberately
  disable i18n for xml (at least in Zope2).
