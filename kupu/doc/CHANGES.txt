============
Kupu changes
============

- Kupu 1.1

  o Added state for buttons, if one is inside a tag controlled by a button
    the button gets a new class (this way when inside e.g. a bold tag the
    bold button can look pressed)

  o Added access keys

- Kupu 1.0.3

  o Added classes for the buttons. This allows them to have an updateState
    as well, which is used to make buttons look 'pressed in' when inside
    certain markup (when inside a bold piece of text, the bold button will
    look different).
    This feature does not break existing installations, but existing initKupu
    functions need to be modified to use the new button classes.

  o Changed the ids of all buttons in the macro. To be consistent the names of
    some existing buttons (the ones to set colors) are modified as well, which
    will break existing installations. Either change the name in the macro or
    adjust kupuInit to fix this problem.

  o Added some code to allow tooloboxes to change class when they are 'active',
    for instance when the cursor is inside a table the table toolbox can look
    different (different backgroundcolor etc.) This is optional and is written
    in a backward compatible way, if existing installations want to use it they
    should modify their custom initKupu (if they use a custom one, that is).

- 1.0.2

  o Added POST support

  o Finally added some more documentation, made some older docs less 
    Zope specific

  o Added toolboxes, a plugin for tools, to seperate functionality from
    view dependencies (this means a change in initKupu, so custom versions
    need to be updated!)

  o Chopped kupueditor.js into several pieces (this means all existing
    installations need to be updated!)

  o Table editing in IE 5.5 is fixed, the tables don't end up
    in the parent document anymore

  o Fixed some subtle bug that caused the parent element of the
    selection to be the selected element instead of the element
    itself when a selection spanned a full element (thanks Igor
    Stroh for the IE fix!)

  o Cleaned up the HTML files and pagetemplates, there's now only 1 piece
    of JavaScript for initialization.

  o Added experimental context menu

  o Added experimental inspector tool

  o A lot of small bugfixes...

- 1.0.1 (2003-12-10)
  
  o Fixed bug that caused saving to fail in Mozilla 1.3.1

  o Fixed bug that prevented Zope from booting when Kupu and Plone were
    installed on the same instance

  o Added an example pagetemplate for Zope 2 integration

- 1.0 final (2003-11-21)

  o Fixed text style support for IE

  o Renamed kuputoolbar macro to kupu_toolbar for consistency

  o Added style sheet and headers to prevent caching in the
    example document fulldoc.html

- 1.0 beta 1 (2003-11-14)

  o Some API cleanups done

  o Added some code to 'disable' the editor during init and save
    [Issue 11]

  o Added Silva-specific JavaScript, also as an example for large
    customizations

  o Fixed major problem with IE that removed the selection from the
    iframe as soon as some other element got clicked (resulting in
    actions to be performed on the wrong location). [issue 31]

  o Fixed colorchooser in IE, also fixed background color support.

- 1.0 alpha 2 (2003-11-07)

  o Refactored kupueditor.js to a MVC-style component architecture.
    [Issue 26]

  o Added a path tool [Issue 24]

  o Added kupu logo

- 1.0 alpha 1 (2003-10-24)

  o Fix useCSS (generates a Midas error)

  o When in a list, a style picker will appear for the shape of the
  list symbols.

  o  Dumb down the link and image toolboxes

  o Let the iframe src work from Apache via a tal:attributes to
    replace the src with nothing when served from Zope

  o Added new attributes on <iframe> to configure the Kupu instance:

    - dst specifices the URL to PUT to.
  
    - usecss is either 0 or 1, to tell Midas whether to use CSS or
      element styles like <b>.

    - reloadsrc is either 0 or 1, to tell Kupu whether the server
      wants the editor to reload the source after saving.  This is
      true in Silva, which transforms the XHTML after saving.

  o Improved error message that appears if an async save fails.

  o Added plain Zope2 integration (philikon)

  o Added functionality for editing tables (adding and deleting
    rows and columns, setting alignment etc.)

  o Fixed bug in link code, the url is now added to the link 
    correctly and can also be modified

  o Replaced some timeout code with a poll loop, which should work
    better in extreme situations (slow setup, large documents etc.)

  o When the cursor is in a list, a drop-down appears to set the style
    of the list symbols (e.g. disc for ul, roman numerals for ol)
