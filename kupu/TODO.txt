This is a todo list that described items related to the new templating
system and inflicted changes. It is to be removed once everything is
completed.

- documentation:

  * XML template schema

  * how to customize / make a distribution

  * how to add a feature

- build framework: I'd like to see a build system such as the following:

  $ make default

  or

  $ make plone

  where make first generates a dist.kupu file (or whatever it'd be
  called) and then runs the XSLT transformation such that the correct
  files are generated and placed in the correct locations (such as
  'kupu.html' in 'default' for the default implementation and
  'wywiwyg_support.html' in 'plone/kupu_plone_layer' for the plone
  implementation).

  XXX: What do windoze users do? Use cygwin's make? Ant (ick)?

     subsystem:
             cd subdir && $(MAKE)


- Testing framework for make.xsl

- For some reason, &nbsp; entities are replaced with an empty string,
  causing tags to be closed in the short syntax. That confuses browsers.

- Get rid of saveonpart code in startkupu and put it in the saveonpart
  feature
