TODO

This is a todo list that described items related to the new templating
system and inflicted changes. It is to be removed once everything is
completed.

- documentation:

  * XML template schema

  * how to customize / make a distribution

  * how to add a feature

- Testing framework for make.xsl

- For some reason, &nbsp; entities are replaced with an empty string,
  causing tags to be closed in the short syntax. That confuses browsers.

- Get rid of saveonpart code in startkupu and put it in the saveonpart
  feature

- Since the common layer does not exist anymore, mergine plone-drawers
  branch will be a little tricky:

  o subversion might recreate the common layer because plone-drawers
  contains a lot of changes to it.

  o Extensions/Install.py should register the 'default' implementation
  as a layer, not 'common' (since it does not exist). Maybe we should
  come up with a new place for resoures like JS, CSS, XSLT files. Or
  maybe not :).
