EcmaUnit changes
================

- EcmaUnit 0.4 (2006-04-11)

  o Added assertNotEquals function.
    [fschulze].

  o Changed object notation, methods are now defined on the prototypes instead
    of inline.

  o Fixed bug in assertEquals so it checks type and does comparisons based on
    that (not doing blatant string conversions anymore).

  o Allowing 'null' exceptions.

  o assertThrows now does instanceof checks, meaning you can pass in a 'class'
    to check whether exceptions are instances of that class, initializing it
    is no longer required.

- EcmaUnit 0.3 (2005-04-19)
  
  o Added tracebacks for Mozilla and Spidermonkey ('verbose' mode).

- EcmaUnit 0.2 (2004-05-27)

  o Factored the reporting mechanism to a separate component
    (HTMLReporter) and added an alternative reporter for command-line
    enviroments (StdoutReporter). This essentially allows running unit
    tests using command line interpreters, e.g. with spidermonkey.

- EcmaUnit 0.1 (2004-05-21)
