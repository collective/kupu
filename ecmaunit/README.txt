========================
ecmaunit unit test suite
========================

This is an object oriented unit test suite library for JavaScript. It is
tested on Internet Explorer and Mozilla and should run on all browers with
decent JavaScript support.

This package can just be placed somewhere on a filesystem or webserver and
used directly by other scripts. For an example (this should be enough to get
you started) see 'testecmaunit.js' and 'testecmaunit.html' (which happen to be
tests for the system as well, although they're a bit awkward for some of them
are supposed to fail for the demo).

If you have any questions, want to report bugs or have suggestions about how
to improve the product, please send an email to Guido Wesdorp 
(guido@infrae.com).

Thanks for using EcmaUnit!
