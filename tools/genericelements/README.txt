========================
Kupu GenericElementsTool
========================

What is it?
-----------

This is a tool for adding arbitrary element types to a document using the Kupu
editor. It will place temporary elements in the document that can be replaced
with real ones on the server or using some specific ContentFilter (needs to be
written by the integrator). 

For who is this package?
------------------------

It was written for CodeName Future by Guido Wesdorp from Infrae. Right now it's
still meant only for that customer, so no support is given for this product
yet. If you want to use it, it will be at your own risk.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.txt
