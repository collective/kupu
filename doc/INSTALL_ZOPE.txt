Installing Kupu on Zope
=======================

Migrating
---------

If you are migrating from Kupu 0.X, please also read MIGRATING.txt


Zope2 without CMF or Plone
--------------------------

1. Requirements

  Make sure you're using Zope 2.5 or higher. Zope 2.7 is
  recommended. You need the FileSystemSite product, version 1.3 or
  higher. You can download it from
  http://zope.org/Members/philikon/FileSystemSite.

2. Installation

  Drop the 'kupu' directory into your instance home's Products
  directory and restart the Zope instance.

3. Using the kupu editor macro

  Typically you want to use the editor macro in your own Page
  Template. First, create an 'kupu editor' object at the top of your
  folder hierarchy and give it an id, e.g. 'kupu'. Then, create a page
  template and make use of the macros and slots documented in
  ZOPEMACROS.txt using 'here/kupu/kupumacros/macros' as TALES path
  prefix (if you have named the editor object 'kupu').  See
  zope2/example.pt for an example.


Zope2 with CMF/Plone
--------------------

1. Requirements

  Make sure you have CMF version 1.4 or higher installed.

2. Installation

  Drop the 'kupu' directory into your instance home's Products
  directory and restart the Zope instance.

  The commended way to install kupu into your CMF or Plone site is
  using CMFQuickInstaller which can be downloaded from the Collective
  project page at sourceforge:
  http://sf.net/projects/collective. Alternatively, execute the
  external method Install.py in the Extensions directory manually from
  your CMF/Plone site.


Zope3
-----

Simply drop the 'kupu' directory into Zope3's zopeproducts directory
and edit your products.zcml file to include::

  <include package="zopeproducts.kupu" />
