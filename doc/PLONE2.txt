Installing Kupu in Plone2
=========================

Requirements
------------

o Zope 2.7 and Python 2.3.3 or greater

o Plone 2.0 or greater

o CMF 1.4 or greater

o An XSLT processor with XInclude support, such as xsltproc from
  Gnome's libxml/libxslt.

Installation
------------

Drop the 'kupu' directory into your instance home's Products
directory. Now generate the Plone template by typing:

  $ make plonemacros

Then restart the Zope instance. Now go to the Plone Control Panel,
section Add/remove Products and select 'kupu' for installation.

Usually, every user has to explicitly set its preferred editor to
'kupu' in 'My Preferences' in order to use kupu.
