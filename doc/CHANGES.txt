============
Kupu changes
============

- Unreleased

  o Fixed kupuform.html, added the correct action to the save button

  o Fixed Zope 2 example.pt template, as it wasn't updated for 1.0.3

- 1.0.3 (2004-03-25)

  o Renamed epoz to kupu to end the name confusion with Maik
    Jablonski's editor once and for all. Thanks to Eric Casteleijn for
    the name suggestion.

  o Kupu is distributed under the BSD-style Kupu license. See
    LICENSE.txt for license text.

  o Kupu is an official OSCOM project now. Its new homepage is
    available at http://kupu.oscom.org. The development home remains
    with Codespeak.

  o Improved preliminary Plone support. Thanks to Duncan G. Booth for
    this work.

  o Fixed bug that made IE throw an exception on re-selecting text in
    a removed element.

  o Removed the 'locales' directory for the time being. We will
    support i18n in the future, but not in this Zope-specific way.

- 1.0.2 (2004-03-06)

  o Added POST support

  o Finally added some more documentation, made some older docs less 
    Zope specific

  o Added toolboxes, a plugin for tools, to seperate functionality from
    view dependencies (this means a change in initEpoz, so custom versions
    need to be updated!)

  o Chopped epozeditor.js into several pieces (this means all existing
    installations need to be updated!)

  o Table editing in IE 5.5 is fixed, the tables don't end up
    in the parent document anymore

  o Fixed some subtle bug that caused the parent element of the
    selection to be the selected element instead of the element
    itself when a selection spanned a full element (thanks Igor
    Stroh for the IE fix!)

  o Cleaned up the HTML files and pagetemplates, there's now only 1 piece
    of JavaScript for initialization.

  o Added experimental context menu

  o Added experimental inspector tool

  o A lot of small bugfixes...

- 1.0.1 (2003-12-10)
  
  o Fixed bug that caused saving to fail in Mozilla 1.3.1

  o Fixed bug that prevented Zope from booting when Epoz and Plone were
    installed on the same instance

  o Added an example pagetemplate for Zope 2 integration

- 1.0 final (2003-11-21)

  o Fixed text style support for IE

  o Renamed epoztoolbar macro to epoz_toolbar for consistency

  o Added style sheet and headers to prevent caching in the
    example document fulldoc.html

- 1.0 beta 1 (2003-11-14)

  o Some API cleanups done

  o Added some code to 'disable' the editor during init and save
    [Issue 11]

  o Added Silva-specific JavaScript, also as an example for large
    customizations

  o Fixed major problem with IE that removed the selection from the
    iframe as soon as some other element got clicked (resulting in
    actions to be performed on the wrong location). [issue 31]

  o Fixed colorchooser in IE, also fixed background color support.

- 1.0 alpha 2 (2003-11-07)

  o Refactored epozeditor.js to a MVC-style component architecture.
    [Issue 26]

  o Added a path tool [Issue 24]

  o Added epoz logo

- 1.0 alpha 1 (2003-10-24)

  o Fix useCSS (generates a Midas error)

  o When in a list, a style picker will appear for the shape of the
  list symbols.

  o  Dumb down the link and image toolboxes

  o Let the iframe src work from Apache via a tal:attributes to
    replace the src with nothing when served from Zope

  o Added new attributes on <iframe> to configure the Epoz instance:

    - dst specifices the URL to PUT to.
  
    - usecss is either 0 or 1, to tell Midas whether to use CSS or
      element styles like <b>.

    - reloadsrc is either 0 or 1, to tell Epoz whether the server
      wants the editor to reload the source after saving.  This is
      true in Silva, which transforms the XHTML after saving.

  o Improved error message that appears if an async save fails.

  o Added plain Zope2 integration (philikon)

  o Added functionality for editing tables (adding and deleting
    rows and columns, setting alignment etc.)

  o Fixed bug in link code, the url is now added to the link 
    correctly and can also be modified

  o Replaced some timeout code with a poll loop, which should work
    better in extreme situations (slow setup, large documents etc.)

  o When the cursor is in a list, a drop-down appears to set the style
    of the list symbols (e.g. disc for ul, roman numerals for ol)
