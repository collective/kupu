============
Kupu changes
============

- Current development version

  o Added support for CSS 'float' for images.

  o Fixed some documentation that said Netscape 7.0 was supported, which
    it never was, the minimal Netscape version required to use Kupu has
    always been 7.1

  o Fixed problem where empty title tags broke rendering on IE after a save.

  o Configurable filtering with whitelists and blacklists which
    significantly speeds up save time on IE.

  o Zoom mode to make Kupu fill the browser window.

  o BeforeUnload handler added which controls all form fields.

  o Plone enhancements:

    - Drawer support now fully integrated.
    - Customisation by control panel or Python script.
    - Paragraph styles may be defined globally or for Archetypes
      fields.
    - Links to Archetypes objects done by UID.
    - Optionally Archetypes can store references for links created by
      Kupu.
    - Optional output transform to hide UIDs and add captions to
      images.
    - Kupu and Epoz can now coexist on the same Plone site.

- Kupu 1.1

  o Re-added experimental dist with inspector.

  o Moved drawers to the experimental dist.

  o Some fixes in the Citation tool and External Source tools

  o Fixed bug that made Kupu break on certain type of meta-tags in the
    editable document.

  o Moved definition list tool to the main and form dist.

  o Made Damian Gajda's SourceEditTool replace the switchSourceEdit function.

- Kupu 1.1 beta 2 (2004-05-27)

  o Added source editing for Silva.

  o Fixed the Image tool in Silva: URL's are now editable and will be made
    relative if at all possible.

  o Fixed some small bugs for Silva.

  o Assured proper hiding of RemoveElementButtons in IE.

  o Updated unit tests to reflect new ECMAUnit API

- Kupu 1.1 beta 1 (2004-05-21)

  o Added Selection object that provides a cross-browser API for working
    with the document's selection and cursor. This can be used to e.g. add
    and manipulate arbitrary elements (it's used for instance in Silva's 
    definition lists code).

  o Templates for different systems are now generated with an
    XML/XSLT-based templating system.

  o Added state for buttons, if one is inside a tag controlled by a button
    the button gets a new class (this way when inside e.g. a bold tag the
    bold button can look pressed).

  o Added access key functionality.

  o Implemented a new way of inserting images and linking to
    documents, library drawers. Drawers are windows that open up
    inside the browser without invoking a browser popup. Library
    drawers load information about linkable/insertable objects from
    the server via standardized XML.

  o Some core functionality is now covered by unit tests, based on the
    JavaScript testing framework ECMAUnit.

  o Fixed bug in preserving selection in IE.

  o Added double-click catching, now double-clicking stuff results in correct
    behaviour.

  o Added a few useful helpers, such as a strip() method to String objects.

- 1.0.3 (2004-03-25)

  o Renamed epoz to kupu to end the name confusion with Maik
    Jablonski's editor once and for all. Thanks to Eric Casteleijn for
    the name suggestion.

  o Kupu is distributed under the BSD-style Kupu license. See
    LICENSE.txt for license text.

  o Kupu is an official OSCOM project now. Its new homepage is
    available at http://kupu.oscom.org. The development home remains
    with Codespeak.

  o Improved preliminary Plone support. Thanks to Duncan G. Booth for
    this work.

  o Fixed bug that made IE throw an exception on re-selecting text in
    a removed element.

  o Removed the 'locales' directory for the time being. We will
    support i18n in the future, but not in this Zope-specific way.

- 1.0.2 (2004-03-06)

  o Added POST support

  o Finally added some more documentation, made some older docs less 
    Zope specific

  o Added toolboxes, a plugin for tools, to seperate functionality from
    view dependencies (this means a change in initEpoz, so custom versions
    need to be updated!)

  o Chopped epozeditor.js into several pieces (this means all existing
    installations need to be updated!)

  o Table editing in IE 5.5 is fixed, the tables don't end up
    in the parent document anymore

  o Fixed some subtle bug that caused the parent element of the
    selection to be the selected element instead of the element
    itself when a selection spanned a full element (thanks Igor
    Stroh for the IE fix!)

  o Cleaned up the HTML files and pagetemplates, there's now only 1 piece
    of JavaScript for initialization.

  o Added experimental context menu

  o Added experimental inspector tool

  o A lot of small bugfixes...

- 1.0.1 (2003-12-10)
  
  o Fixed bug that caused saving to fail in Mozilla 1.3.1

  o Fixed bug that prevented Zope from booting when Epoz and Plone were
    installed on the same instance

  o Added an example pagetemplate for Zope 2 integration

- 1.0 final (2003-11-21)

  o Fixed text style support for IE

  o Renamed epoztoolbar macro to epoz_toolbar for consistency

  o Added style sheet and headers to prevent caching in the
    example document fulldoc.html

- 1.0 beta 1 (2003-11-14)

  o Some API cleanups done

  o Added some code to 'disable' the editor during init and save
    [Issue 11]

  o Added Silva-specific JavaScript, also as an example for large
    customizations

  o Fixed major problem with IE that removed the selection from the
    iframe as soon as some other element got clicked (resulting in
    actions to be performed on the wrong location). [issue 31]

  o Fixed colorchooser in IE, also fixed background color support.

- 1.0 alpha 2 (2003-11-07)

  o Refactored epozeditor.js to a MVC-style component architecture.
    [Issue 26]

  o Added a path tool [Issue 24]

  o Added epoz logo

- 1.0 alpha 1 (2003-10-24)

  o Fix useCSS (generates a Midas error)

  o When in a list, a style picker will appear for the shape of the
  list symbols.

  o  Dumb down the link and image toolboxes

  o Let the iframe src work from Apache via a tal:attributes to
    replace the src with nothing when served from Zope

  o Added new attributes on <iframe> to configure the Epoz instance:

    - dst specifices the URL to PUT to.
  
    - usecss is either 0 or 1, to tell Midas whether to use CSS or
      element styles like <b>.

    - reloadsrc is either 0 or 1, to tell Epoz whether the server
      wants the editor to reload the source after saving.  This is
      true in Silva, which transforms the XHTML after saving.

  o Improved error message that appears if an async save fails.

  o Added plain Zope2 integration (philikon)

  o Added functionality for editing tables (adding and deleting
    rows and columns, setting alignment etc.)

  o Fixed bug in link code, the url is now added to the link 
    correctly and can also be modified

  o Replaced some timeout code with a poll loop, which should work
    better in extreme situations (slow setup, large documents etc.)

  o When the cursor is in a list, a drop-down appears to set the style
    of the list symbols (e.g. disc for ul, roman numerals for ol)
