==========================
The kupu Templating System
==========================

Problem
-------

kupu is an editor with many features, many of them optional or
specific to certain integration implementations. While it is fairly
easy to maintain the JavaScript side of features through separate
files, the HTML template has to be custom constructed for every
feature combination.

Kupu 1.0 thus comes with five different templates. Zope-based
applications would just require one template because they could turn
certain parts of the template on and off by filling ZPT
slots. However, applications not using Zope Page Templates (ZPTs) have
to customize one of the provided templates. That not only means manual
editing of the templates in order to configure the feature set, it
also means the lack of an automatic update when a new kupu version is
released.


Goals
-----

We want to...

  o involve as few files as possible when adding a new feature to
    kupu. We preferrably only want to add a file for the JavaScript
    part of the feature and a file for the template part of the
    feature.

  o be able to disable a feature whenever we want under any
    circumstance.

  o allow and encourage third party developers to develop plugins
    (i.e. new features) for kupu that can be distributed outside the
    main kupu integration and yet be included without manual
    adjustments.

  o be able to include platform specific markup when necessary.

  o rely on templating standards (XML, XSLT, XInclude, etc.)

It is clear, that a system-indepentend templating system is needed to
ease kupu's integration into other systems and any customization that
is required by such a process.


Definitions
-----------

Slot

  A position in a template, at which markup can be inserted. Example:
  the HTML header, the HTML body.

Feature

  A bundle of code and markup providing a certain set of
  functionality. Examples for basic features are: the editor frame,
  toolbar with buttons, colorchooser, synchronous form-based or
  asynchronous document-centric editing support. Examples for more
  advanced and optional features are: save on part, autosave, context
  menu, source editing, library drawer.

Part

  A part of a Feature. While order usually does not matter when
  writing JavaScript prototypes (or including them from a file), order
  in a template *does* matter. Therefore, a Feature can consist of
  different parts which are distributed throughout the template at the
  appropriate places (Slots). Example: The parts of the source edit
  feature are the button in the toolbar that enables source editing
  and the function that is called when the button is clicked.

Implementation

  Combination of target platform specific Features or Parts of
  Features. The way Features are implemented might vary througout
  different integration layers, due to the requirements of the target
  platforms. Examples of Implementations are: Default (the default set
  of Features), Zope (re-implementation of certain features for Zope
  integration), Plone, Silva, Apache Lenya, MMBase, etc.

Distribution

  Set of Feature definitions or Feature disablings in the context of a
  certain Implementation or order of Implementations. Distributions
  can not only differ from integration layer to integration layer, but
  also be customized for every application or system Kupu is part
  of. Kupu thus only provides *default* distributions, e.g.:
  Distribution for default Features, Distribution for Plone,
  Distribution for Silva, Distributon for Silva, etc. Web Developer
  XYZ might choose to make a custom distribution for the application
  (s)he's building for customer ABC.


Whenever the above defined words appear in the text below, their first
letter is capitalized. Otherwise, the term is used in its conventional
meaning.


Perceptions
-----------

o An Implementation overrides one or more features defined by default
  Implementations or defines new features

o Wiring Parts to Slots is Distribution-specific.

o Implementation Order is Distribution-specific.

o Feature enabling/disabling is Distribution-specific, but usually
  more specific to the target application than to the pre-packaged
  Distribution.


Proposal
========


File system structure
---------------------

kupu's main template (kupumacros.html) is split into logical chunks
resembling Features and Parts as defined above. Each Feature and all
its parts resides in an XML file with the file ending '.kupu'. All
features of an Implementation reside in the same directory. The main
kupu distribution includes a directory named 'default'. It contains a
default set of Features in their default Implementation. Platform
specific markup resides in other Implementation directories.

A Distribution is represented in an XML file typically named
'dist.kupu'. It defines an order in which Features are looked up in
Implementations and can optionally disable Features.

A system consisting of XSLT templates is used to parse a Distribution
configuration file and construct markup custom to that particular
Distribution. The XInclude standard is used to combine all .kupu XML
files to one large tree that can be fed to an XSLT processor.

Overview:
- - - - -

kupu/                      (the root directory of the kupu distribution)
kupu/dist.kupu             (kupu's default Distribution file)

kupu/default/              ('default' Implementation of Features)
kupu/default/feature1.kupu
kupu/default/feature2.kupu
kupu/default/include.kupu  (imports all Features from the 'default'
                            Implementation for convenience)

kupu/foo.kupu              (imports all 'foo' Features file for convenience)
kupu/foo/                  ('Foo' Implementation)
kupu/foo/feature1.kupu
kupu/foo/feature2.kupu
kupu/foo/foo.py            (some additional platform specific files)
kupu/foo/Foo.class

    <p>We can also refer to our own part, but in a different
