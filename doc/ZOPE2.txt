========================
Installing Kupu on Zope2
========================

Requirements
-------------

- Zope 2.5 or higher, Zope 2.7 recommended.

- FileSystemSite product, version 1.3 or higher, available at
  http://zope.org/Members/philikon/FileSystemSite.

Installation
------------

Drop the 'kupu' directory into your instance home's Products
directory. XXX generate HTML template XXX. Then restart the Zope
instance.

Using the kupu editor macro
---------------------------

XXX needs update:

Typically you want to use the editor macro in your own Page
Template. First, create an 'kupu editor' object at the top of your
folder hierarchy and give it an id, e.g. 'kupu'. Then, create a page
template and make use of the macros and slots documented in
ZOPEMACROS.txt using 'here/kupu/kupumacros/macros' as TALES path
prefix (if you have named the editor object 'kupu').  See
zope2/example.pt for an example.

Migrating from Epoz
-------------------

Kupu has a totally different approach than Epoz. While Epoz provides a
global python function called 'Epoz' that was callable from Python
Script, DTML and ZPT, we have done away with the triple-code
generation in the Kupu 1.0 tree.

Kupu mainly consists of a filesystem-based layer. The editor
application itself is a combination of ECMAScripts and a Page Template
macro. This way, the same code not only works in Silva, Zope2, CMF,
and Zope3, but it also can be seen right off the filesystem.

In order to use Kupu in your custom Zope2 application, you will have
to make these filesystem-based ZPT macros available to your ZODB-based
Page Templates. The easiest way is to use the zope2 integration
package using the FileSystemSite product. It can be downloaded at
http://zope.org/Members/philikon/FileSystemSite.

Once you have installed FileSystemSite and Kupu in your Products
directory, you will see a new addable meta type called 'kupu
editor'. Add this one to the top-most folder of your Zope2
application. A common id would be 'kupu'. If you look inside the
object you just created, you will see that it provides all
filesystem-based page templates and ECMAScript files to the ZODB.

XXX needs update:

You can now create a page template and use the macro defined in
'kupumacros.html'. See ZOPEMACROS.txt for more information on what
macros are exposed and what slots you can fill.
