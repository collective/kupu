TODO for drawers
================

- link/image drawer: support re-editing of link or image

- improve library drawer UI

  + particular problem: "Current location: ..." is only shown when a
    drawer is closed and re-opened. CSS problem?

- improve table and link drawer UI

- issue 63: Archetypes RichTextWidget + Kupu + content_type choice

- test xml output, or rather the corresponding python methods


IE problems and fixes
=====================

o IE6 on WinXP crashes upon saving, if a drawer has been opened in the
  Kupu session.

  Fix: get rid of the drawer element before saving form
  data. Implemented and tested by guido, no confirmation yet

o xsl:import needs provide a valid URI; it seems IE cannot import an
  XSL file that is linked with a relative path (as reported by duncan,
  reproduced by philiKON).

  Fix in Plone: generate XSL templates with ZPT, providing an absolute
  URI for the import statements.

o container.ownerDocument.contentWindow = doc.contentWindow; fails:
  "object doesn't support this property or method".

  Solution: do not execute on IE (it seems not to be needed anyway).

o importNode(node) fails on XML Document nodes. Use
  node.cloneNode(true) as a hack.

o IE doesn't seem to accept the dynamic setting of display:block. It
  does not display the element as a block element, but inline.

  Solution: wrap the div that is to appear as a block element in
  another <div style="display:block;"> element.
